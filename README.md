This is a Google Chrome extension that replaces Twitch.tv's native Flash player with a VLC player using [VLC's official web plugin](https://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:WebPlugin/#VLC_objects).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`, enable *Developer mode* and press *Load unpacked extension...*.
3. Select the `src` folder within this repository.
4. Install VLC &amp; its web plugin. Installing VLC is easy, but the process for installing the web plugin differs per operating system and web browser (Mac OS X: [download the latest VLC-webplugin-****.dmg](http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/macosx-intel/?C=N;O=A)).
5. Visit your favorite streamer's channel and enjoy a lifestyle slightly less dependent on Flash.
